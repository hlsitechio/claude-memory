--- Session 1 ---
Memory: Added input validation middleware and database migration for filtering feature. Found auth bypass when Content-Type header is omitted. 3 new columns in users table.
Context: Preparing for v2.1 release. Filtering feature is the last blocker. Auth bypass is a security issue that needs immediate fix before release.
Intent: Fix auth middleware to reject requests without valid Content-Type. Write tests for the fix. Then build filtering API endpoints using new schema columns.
